# weather-dashboard

As a developer, I wanted to create a webpage that uses third-party API's to create a weather dashboard that will run in the browser. With the help of a 3rd party API, it will allow users to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL.

## Expectations

I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities in order to plan accordingly. 

The weather dashboard must have form inputs for a city. Once the user enters in the info, they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history. 

Once he user clicks on the 'view current weather conditions' for that city, they are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed

When they view future weather conditions for that city, they are then presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

## Usage

This webpage will show weather data for different cities.
